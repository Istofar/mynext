      <p>
        I am a nerdy prolific gamer who spends most of his time tending to
        alternate universes. I love creative Story Telling, and love to
        appreciate the hardwork delivered to the world by developers and every
        one of the nerdy consumers out there. I also code to bring a little bit
        of that Art to life for the world to see. I value technical features
        that i see in AAA websites which i also try to tend to implement in my
        work also. Problem Solving is the key ability in programming.
        Programming is all about it........it is a neccessary skill buff
